              My name is Brendan, a Post-doctoral Research Fellow working with <a href="https://jef.works/" target="_blank">Prof. Jean Fan</a> in the <a href="https://www.bme.jhu.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Biomedical Engineering</a> and <a href="https://ccb.jhu.edu/people.php#postdocs" target="_blank">Center for Computational Biology</a> at Johns Hopkins University (JHU). Here, I have been developing open-source computational pipelines and statistical software to characterize and visualize cell type spatial organizational patterns in tissues. Two of my projects are now published and available as downloadable software (<code>MERINGUE</code> and <code>STdeconvolve</code>), which you can check out below in my <b>Featured Projects</b>. I have worked with a LOT of different types of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-01033-y" target="_blank">Spatial Transcriptomics</a> datasets and technologies, as well as single-cell data to help annotate and characterize different spatial patterns in tissues. <br><br>

              I earned my PhD from Johns Hopkins University in March 2020 where I was part of the <a href="https://cmdb.jhu.edu/" target="_blank">Cellular, Molecular, Developmental Biology and Biophysics Department</a> and a member of the <a href="https://www.training.nih.gov/programs/gpp/partner/jhu" target="_blank">Graduate Partnership Program</a> between the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and JHU. This meant that I had the opportunity to receive part of my training at JHU and also perform my thesis work at the NIH. This was done under the guidance of <a href="https://irp.nih.gov/pi/laura-elnitski" target="_blank">Dr. Laura Elnitski</a> in the National Human Genome Research Institute. <br><br>

              During my PhD I developed cancer detection assays based on patterns of DNA methylation in circulating cell-free DNA from blood plasma samples (aka liquid biopsies). During this time, I optimized a single molecule detection assay to quantify rare fragments of methylated cell-free DNA in patient plasma. I further developed computational machine learning algorithms leveraging heterogeneous methylation patterns to optimize liquid biopsy cancer diagnostics. <br><br>

              <b>My foundational training has been in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry but during the last 10 years I have been learning to leverage this knowledge through code. Looking forward, I'm excited to integrate my foundational training as a wet lab biologist with computational strategies to help solve fundamental problems in health and disease!</b>
